# Unemployment_Analysis-With-Python

Hello connections! 👋 I'm glad to share that I've completed my project named Unemployment analysis with python.

📊 Data Exploration and Cleaning: Starting by loading the data and ensuring its quality.

📈 Descriptive Statistics: I calculated summary statistics like mean, standard deviation, and quartiles for unemployment rate, employed count, and labor participation rate. These provide a comprehensive overview of the situation.

🌍 Geographical Analysis: Using geographical coordinates, I visualized unemployment rates across India, uncovering patterns that might be otherwise missed.

📊 Region-wise Insights: By breaking down the data by regions, I discovered trends in unemployment rates, offering a nuanced view of the problem. The bar charts and sunburst plot I created highlight average unemployment rates by region and state.

💡 Key Insights: This analysis has implications for policymakers, economists, researchers, and businesses alike.
